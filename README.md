## General info
This week's class-13-14-3 group project is to build an accessible & responsive clone of ![Hack Your Future](https://hackyourfuture.be/), HackYourFuture Belgium is an initiative of Open Knowledge Belgium. We don't expect for all the buttons to have the same behavior, but visually the site should be identical to the real Hack-Your-Future.
