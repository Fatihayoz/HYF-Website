# Copy of HYF-Website
This repository is for making a copy of www.hackyourfuture.be

This week's class-13-14-3 group project is to build an accessible & responsive clone of ![Hack Your Future](https://hackyourfuture.be/), HackYourFuture Belgium is an initiative of Open Knowledge Belgium. We don't expect for all the buttons to have the same behavior, but visually the site should be identical to the real Hack-Your-Future.

To run this project out we will divide Hack-Your-Future into many small parts. Each part will be developed in a different branch for each member of the group and at the end of the work we will have to merge all the branches to the main/master branch. Each part will have its own developemnt strategy and we can follow each progress in the project board named  ![class-13-14-group-3: Hack-Your-Future](https://github.com/Fatihayoz/HYF-Website)
